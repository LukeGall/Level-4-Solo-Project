# Meeting 3

## Should I use a github wiki to put any code documentation and notes I make?
Yeah I should

## Would it be more important for me to focus on features instead of appearance?
Want someone to play it, so it will need some polish. So a mix of both

## In terms of this being more a software product focused project, what things should I keep in mind while I get on with the code. Documentation, wireframes, plans etc?
Yeah that's all good.

## Show the code I have atm, even if it is ugly



## Minutes
Happy with the progress I've made, think it's looking good and knows that this week might not get as much done as I'll be focusing more on my assignments
