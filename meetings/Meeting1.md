# Meeting 1

## Is it okay to do a web app instead of Java Swing?
Yes it's all good

## How I should prepare for meetings in the future? I.e.how things are going, want anything sent?
A set of questions plus what I did. Let her know if I can't make it that week

## Do I need to do a literature review?
Can log in to the GU Library might give more access, or VPN. Have a look at them, look more broadly for educational games, online board games, look at downfall. How is it been implemented before.

## Go over the mindmap
Done

## Talk through plan (Very rough)
Done

## How would this I change the project into a more logic focussed one?
More just the logic of the pieces, but maybe difficult.

## Minutes
Happy with my progress and happy for me to do a webapp style for the project. Can have a look at some other board games online for the background section. Could maybe focus on some of the logic but it might be difficult to write stuff about it.
