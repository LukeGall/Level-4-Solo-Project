## Discuss plan of this week
The plan for this week is to focus on refactoring and testing for most of it, will help make the program maintainable down the line. By refactoring the large board service, it will make it easier to add the next feature which is default puzzles for the app. SVGs should be added for the components, will meet the "MVP" of the project. 

## Questions

# Should I have a set of functional requirements (written down) I should be aiming towards?
I know what they are already, and what is essential and maybes (animation).  

# For the evaluation phase in the dissertation will I be able to send this among my peers?
Can get a user evaluation to get data, could maybe try to get some children to use too. 

# Is testing and refactoring an important part or should I aim for more features?
Yes it is. 

# The site will likely break on mobile phones but I don't think it would be worth my time to implement this as a feature compared to the other options.
Yeah that's all good

# I'm happy with how I'm progressing so far but is there any major thing I'm missing? (not sure if this can be asked)
Yup all good

Happy with how the meeting went, Prof. Miller likes the look of the app and is happy with the time I spent on it, even though I would rather have done it quicker.
