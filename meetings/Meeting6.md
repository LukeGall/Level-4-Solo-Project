# Meeting 6 (16 Nov)

## Show the new appearance of the board with the new icons

## Discuss plan of this week
The plan for this week is to focus on allowing puzzles to be made in a new page and then being able to play these puzzles. Will need to work on people being able to log in and view the puzzles others have created as well. 
Made around 30 unit tests plus some e2e tests and removed a lot of bloated code and was happy with the refactoring I got done. 

## Questions

Just want to show progress but happy with how things are going. 

# Minutes
