# Meeting 10 (20th Jan)

## Talk about work done since last meeting
* Added complex examples to the plain board page
* Can now upload and save boards
* More tests
* Had some basic user evals done by family, which lead to bug fixes and some more information on the tutorial
* More e2e tests, cleanup and some refactoring
* Write up of issues experienced while developing
* status report

* Notes where taken from a hall of fame project similar to mine
* Marbles can now 'fall' 
* User surveys and tasks created, plus questions (show these)
* Ethics brief and debrief script
* Lots of code documentation

## Ask questions

### How are the user tasks and questions?
Looks good. 

### Should I add a section to the dissertation of issues faced?
Yes definitely. 

### Should I focus on writing the dissertation now? Should I add any more code?
Could spend some time polishing but it wouldn't be to useful overall. Write your dissertation now, it is a better use of time. 

### If I get some good evaluation of improvements should I look to add these?
It's up to me, if I have time I can.

### Is it okay to ask people to login via Google
Ask Tim if that is all okay.

### Is it still okay to ask 16+ aged school pupils to have a go with the site?
Yup it's still a good idea

## Discuss plan of this week
* Finish up documentation
* Created component diagram showing the connection between them all
* Run monitored user evals
* Send out unmonitored user evals
* Start analysing the data gathered from these evals 

# Minutes 
Good meeting so far, thought I made good progress and that I should focus on dissertation over adding more code without massive requirement.
