# Initial Meeting 

## Qu: What days suit for you best for a regular meeting?
	Any day mostly, just give me an email / Teams

## Qu: Does it need to be Swing or could I spend some time researching java fx instead?
	The educational part is with the Java swing, the underlying logic can be 	programmed in it or a different language / UI package. 

## Qu: I assume it's a good idea to get a physical copy of Turing Tumble? Any place you recommend getting it from? 
	Try and get the game if possible. Careful looking at the online one too much, would 	be really tempted to copy online work.  

## Rough minutes 
Got a puzzle book in the physical, which can be used to teach how the game works.  Could be used for an educational tool for masters tool to teach them Java Swing. Can find something you enjoy (ie the logic) and work with that. 
Meet if you have something to say, not just to meet. 
Next meeting should be end of next week or start of following. 
Start dissertation straight away, Title and name, put notes in the dissertation. Put notes, diagrams etc during the project. 

## Discussed my initial plan for the first week as follows
Initial plan for this week
    * Establish some ideas using a mind map and then discuss at next meeting 
    * Write a short concise timeline for the rest of the project
    * Set up environment
    * Learn and research more about Swing or Java fx
    * Spend time researching about Turing tumble and any virtual counterparts online. Could maybe look at how other marble games have been virtualised?
