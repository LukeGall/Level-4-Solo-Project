# Meeting 13 (24th Feb)

## Talk about work done since last meeting
* First rough draft finished, ~54 pages in total, including images and references
* New save board implementation
* Backend data optimisation 
* Next puzzle button
* Can go back stages when creating a puzzle

## Ask questions

### Do I need to include citation for the external libraries I use?

### For implementation, how low level should I go? Or should I focus on high level details of features added and roughly how


### (Show picture of Turing Tumble) Is this an acceptable image to use? Or should I take my own?



## Discuss plan of this week
