Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester
* **Week 2** Establish design ideas, Write short concise timeline, Set up environment, Learn and research more about different frameworks including Swing, and some web ones, Learn more about the Turing Tumble and any virtual counterparts online until physical one arrives. 
* **Week 3** Spend time getting to know turing tumble including a write up of all components and the logic it should include. Plan components that will represent the board pieces. Get a basic board on screen that allows clicks to place 'components'. Start simple and build up
* **Week 4** Create basic board interaction and then Focus on getting marbles to 'drop' and follow logic of the board. Lit review of other online games
* **Week 5** Improve appearance of board, add marbles into a next step style of loop instead of just rushing to the end. Spend time on lit review. Add marbles to the screen when falling.
* **Week 6** Update wiki about code documentation. Continue lit review for background. More board appearance improvement. 
* **Week 7** Board appearance and main page creation then maybe addition of images for parts and ability to maybe open up puzzles.
* **Week 8** Create of unit and e2e tests that will allow some basic refactoring before new features get added, work on some icons for the pieces. 
* **Week 9** Allow the creation and saving of different puzzles for the board to follow that can then be uploaded online to create a puzzle community. Default puzzles should be made. 
* **Week 10** Finish up authentication and Tutorial page. 
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]** Clean up code, clean up appearance, work on any bugs
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Ensure code is easy to use, run, and is in a clean state. Status report submitted.
