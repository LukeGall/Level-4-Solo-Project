* 2298070g
* Prof. Alice Miller

Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1** Establish design ideas, Write short concise timeline, Set up environment, Learn and research more about different framworks including Swing, and some web ones, Learn more about the Turing Tumble and any virtual counterparts online until physical one arrives. 
* **Week 2** Spend time getting to know turing tumble including a write up of all components and the logic it should include. Spend time researching why it was made and the other virtual versions out there
* **Week 3** Create basic board interaction and then Focus on getting marbles to drop and follow physics, maybe work on a component
* **Week 4** Add more components and start thinking about tutorial aspects
* **Week 5** 
* **Week 6** 
* **Week 7**

* **Week 9** 
* **Week 10** 
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]** Clean up code, clean up appearence, work on any bugs
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Ensure code is easy to use, run, and is in a clean state. Status report submitted.

## Winter break
