	abstract = {The concept of intrinsic motivation has been considered to lie at the heart of the user engagement created by digital games. Yet despite this, educational software has traditionally attempted to harness games as extrinsic motivation by using them as a sugar-coating for learning content. This paper tests the concept of intrinsic integration as a way of creating a more productive relationship between educational games and their learning content. Two studies assessed this approach by designing and evaluating an educational game for teaching mathematics to seven to eleven year olds called Zombie Division. Study 1 examined learning gains of 58 children who played either the intrinsic, extrinsic or control variants of Zombie Division for two hours, supported by their classroom teacher. Study 2 compared time-on-task for intrinsic and extrinsic variants of the game when 16 children had free choice between them. The results of these studies showed that children learned more from the intrinsic version of the game under fixed time limits and spent seven times longer playing it in free time situations. Together they offer evidence for the genuine value of an intrinsic approach for creating effective educational games. The theoretical and commercial implications of these findings are discussed.},

Motivating children to learn effectively: exploring the value of intrinsic integration in educational games
HASGOOD, MP Jacob and AINSWORTH, Shaaron E
 
This paper discusses the increased attention and educational gains gained from an intrinsic game compared to the standard extrinsic type. Intrinsic in this concept means to play for the enjoyment of it and not be motivated by external factors, extrinsic is playing due to external motivation factors.
This paper found that intrinsic games increase the amount of time that children can be expected to play the game, plus the amount of learning they gained from it as they are more involved in the game when they enjoy it.},

	abstract = {This study demonstrates a game-based learning (GBL) approach to engage students in learning and enhance their programming skills. The paper gives a detailed narrative of how an educational game was mapped with the curriculum of a prescribed programming course in a computing diploma study programme. Two separate student cohorts were invited to participate in the GBL experiment. One student cohort had not yet started study of the programming module, while the second student cohort had recently completed the module on programming. Findings reveal that educational games add to the fun element in learning, and students rated the game as an effective way to learn programming. Students could easily relate gaming elements to difficult programming constructs. Animated game scenarios showed high levels of engagement among students. Some students found the use of gaming elements as a better way to express their program’s logic when giving oral presentations for the final assessment. Results indicate that a majority of study participants passed the programming module in the first attempt. The study contributes to the use of gaming elements for ongoing development of innovative pedagogies in teaching and learning.},

	abstract = {Turing Tumble is a toy gravity-fed mechanical computer (similar to the classic Open image in new window , but including additional types of pieces such as gears), in which marbles roll down a board, along paths determined by the locations of ramps, toggles and gears, which are placed by the “programmer,” and by their current states, which are altered by the passing marbles. Aaronson proved that a Open image in new window decision problem (viz., will any marbles reach the sink?) is Open image in new window -Complete, i.e., equivalent to evaluating comparator circuits, and posed the question of what additional functionality would raise the machine’s computational power beyond Open image in new window , speculating that a capability for toggles to affect one another’s states (which Open image in new window gears happen to provide) might suffice. This turns out to be so: we show, though a simple reduction from a variant of the circuit value problem ( Open image in new window ), that the Open image in new window decision problem is Open image in new window -Complete. The two models also differ in complexity when exponentially (or unboundedly) many marbles are permitted: while Open image in new window remains in Open image in new window , Open image in new window becomes Open image in new window -Complete.},

However, there are relatively few sound empirical studies in the scientific literature that have shown the benefits of learning mathematics from games as opposed to more traditional approaches. The empirical study reported in this paper provides evidence that a mathematics educational game can provide superior learning opportunities, as well as be more engaging. In a study involving 153 students from two middle schools, 70 students learned about decimals from playing an educational game—Decimal Point—whereas 83 students learned the same content by a more conventional, computer-based approach. The game led to significantly better gain scores in solving decimal problems, on both an immediate (d = .43) and delayed (d = .37) posttest and was rated as significantly more enjoyable (d = .95). Low prior knowledge students especially benefitted from the game. This paper also summarizes the game’s design characteristics.},

The results show that engagement in the game has a clear positive effect on learning, however, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect between immersion in the game and learning. Challenge of the game had a positive effect on learning both directly and via the increased engagement. Being skilled in the game did not affect learning directly but by increasing engagement in the game. Both the challenge of the game and being skilled in the game had a positive effect on both being engaged and immersed in the game. The challenge in the game was an especially strong predictor of learning outcomes. For the design of educational games, the results suggest that the challenge of the game should be able to keep up with the learners growing abilities and learning in order to endorse continued learning in game-based learning environments.},
