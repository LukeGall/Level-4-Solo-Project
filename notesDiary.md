## Notes

This diary style note file is an idea that was suggested by my research methods and techniques course. It will mainly just be a place to write notes and put any ideas I have on a page somewhere.

I will try and spend most of my project work today on designing wireframes for the look and feel of the main board style page. It will only really contain the board and the piece selection menu held on the left mainly. Wireframes could also possibly be made for the idea of loading in a different puzzle, so maybe it could have a list to select from different puzzles which then can be loaded into the main board page which I'll focus on cleaning up this week.

A couple of wireframes have been made so far, 2 for the main home page and one for how the board component should be cleaned up. I think I'm leaning more towards the second design as I prefer the focus on the virtual board with the idea to have menus that can be hidden away. These may be easier to work with different sized displays as well. The board component just needs its ratio fixed with a nicer display to have the numbers inside the colour marble they represent.

Will focus on making another wireframe for the main page that will aim to improve on the 2 initial designs made yesterday. 
Wireframe 1 is a fairly basic design which is based on common web apps made during level 2. The top level nav bar is not something I like too much but the 2 side bars for the board are quite nice.
Wireframe 2 is slightly cleaner design but the second part should maybe not be connected to the side nav bar and ensure that these can be pulled in and out when the user wishes. The left part of the sidebar (the bit with pieces in it) could maybe be left as it will change based on the page? For example if it is default puzzles this should be a list of puzzles which when selected will display the board in the centre which will act as it starting board? Plus piece conditions.

I like my third design a lot more than the first two, it looks much cleaner and is much more focused on the board itself than the other parts, like options etc. Think the idea of a sliding menu with nav is a nice touch too.
