## Notes

This diary style note file is an idea that was suggested by my research methods and techniques course. It will mainly just be a place to write notes and put any ideas I have on a page somewhere.

I will try and spend most of my project work today on designing wireframes for the look and feel of the main board style page. It will only really contain the board and the piece selection menu held on the left mainly. Wireframes could also possibly be made for the idea of loading in a different puzzle, so maybe it could have a list to select from different puzzles which then can be loaded into the main board page which I'll focus on cleaning up this week.

A couple of wireframes have been made so far, 2 for the main home page and one for how the board component should be cleaned up. I think I'm leaning more towards the second design as I prefer the focus on the virtual board with the idea to have menus that can be hidden away. These may be easier to work with different sized displays as well. The board component just needs its ratio fixed with a nicer display to have the numbers inside the colour marble they represent.

Will focus on making another wireframe for the main page that will aim to improve on the 2 initial designs made yesterday. 
Wireframe 1 is a fairly basic design which is based on common web apps made during level 2. The top level nav bar is not something I like too much but the 2 side bars for the board are quite nice.
Wireframe 2 is slightly cleaner design but the second part should maybe not be connected to the side nav bar and ensure that these can be pulled in and out when the user wishes. The left part of the sidebar (the bit with pieces in it) could maybe be left as it will change based on the page? For example if it is default puzzles this should be a list of puzzles which when selected will display the board in the centre which will act as it starting board? Plus piece conditions.

I like my third design a lot more than the first two, it looks much cleaner and is much more focused on the board itself than the other parts, like options etc. Think the idea of a sliding menu with nav is a nice touch too.

Will rewrite a few of my paper summaries today to make them more suitable for the lit review, will try and work on the appearance of the site for a couple of hours at least too, probably focusing on getting the side nav bar as a first important part.

Header has been created that contains the title, menu icon and a link the github source code. The default theme was always changed.

Want to get as much of wireframe 3 implemented today and then move onto the board wireframe if possible. Don't really want to spend more than this week on appearance so I can get more of the logic done for the other main features of the app, so hopefully it goes well and has no major set backs. 

A bit slow on making the nav bar and side bar but happy with the results, made a few silly errors trying to remember some css but got there in the end. Plan to get the board done tomorrow and I'm fairly confident it'll look quite nice at the end of it.

Plan to get the rest of the board finished looking nice today, then can maybe take a step back and look at where else the project should go, check my plan and update it to reflect the progress made during this week but hopeful the project will continue to go well without too many hiccups.

Board is looking good, just got one small bit to do with the collected marble counter then I'll be happy to move onto another section of the project. 

The board and the main screen now match the wireframe I made at the start of the week which is awesome, a bit slow in parts as I needed to re learn some basic css and get it working nicely with a sliding view but happy with the result so far. Next week will be concerned with more logic I think. 

Adding an option for blue and red marbles to be added and removed from the dispensers. A button has been added to remove the board of pieces as well
