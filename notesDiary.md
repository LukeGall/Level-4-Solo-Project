## Notes

This diary style note file is an idea that was suggested by my research methods and techniques course. It will mainly just be a place to write notes and put any ideas I have on a page somewhere.

I will try and spend most of my project work today on designing wireframes for the look and feel of the main board style page. It will only really contain the board and the piece selection menu held on the left mainly. Wireframes could also possibly be made for the idea of loading in a different puzzle, so maybe it could have a list to select from different puzzles which then can be loaded into the main board page which I'll focus on cleaning up this week.

A couple of wireframes have been made so far, 2 for the main home page and one for how the board component should be cleaned up. I think I'm leaning more towards the second design as I prefer the focus on the virtual board with the idea to have menus that can be hidden away. These may be easier to work with different sized displays as well. The board component just needs its ratio fixed with a nicer display to have the numbers inside the colour marble they represent.
