### Week 2

## 7 Oct 2020
* *1 hour* Write up of the Turing Tumble Pieces and any logic it will need to contain
* *0.5 hour* Very basic plan of organisation of components and services
* *1.5 hour* Basic set up of components and interfaces
* *0.5 hour* Meeting prep
* *0.5 hour* Meeting plus write up

* *2 hours* Creation of side bar and re arranging of component data so components can be placed on slot while still being part of the boardService board
* *1 hour* Updated boardService to allow pin components to now have gears added

## 9 Oct 2020
* *1 hour* Allow compSlots to have ramps and crossovers added to each other, also did testing to ensure the board object gets updated and ensures each component has it's own unique part in it
* *2 hour* Added all components that can now be added to the Pin and CompSlots, made a angular component for every possible TT component and ensured that the classes and passed correctly to each individual class while still be accessed by the board service

## 11 Oct 2020
* *1 hour* Plan of marble class and how it will interact with the board and components placed on the board, quick creation of new classes and functions that will be fleshed out later.

### Week 3
